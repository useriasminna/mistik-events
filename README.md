# Mistik Events
## Purpose<hr>
Mistik Events is a website created for people who need entertainment services or decorations for special events in their lives. The target audience is made up of people of any age except children because the site specifically targets people who participate in organizing the event and can make the decision of requesting the services offered by Mistik Events. This site will also be useful for people to get the best information about Mistik Events and what it has to offer.<br><br>

## Design<hr>
### Color Scheme
Because this site reflects the theme of night events, the predominant colors used for the font are dark colors.
The Home page cover contains color as brown and blue that suggest the ideea of a party and introduces the customer with the company activity.<br>
In order to maintain a constant design for the whole website, the footer, the second cover and one of the buttons I created contain the same brown color.<br>
For a classic aspect and a good contrast I used a white background with a lighter dark color for text.<br>
All the buttons and links on the website use the same lighter dark color, as well as a lighter gray to make it easier for the user to differentiate between them and their purpose.<br><br>

### Images
I have used 27 images for creating this site, including background images.<br>
Most of the images are real images from my own source that are representing the services that Mistik Events has to offer. <br>
Except for the slider and the gallery page images I used the other ones as background as I considered them being purely decorative.<br>
The images meet the clarity requirements and their dimensions have been adapted for each device so that they are never distorted. Also all the images have been optimised and compressed with [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/)
